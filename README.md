# Task 5 – Python Basics: Data Cleaning with Pandas

## 📌 Overview
This task focuses on basic data cleaning and preprocessing using **Python (Pandas)**.  
The objective is to load a dataset, explore its structure, clean missing and duplicate data, perform simple transformations, and save a cleaned dataset for further analysis.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

---

## 📂 Dataset
- Dataset used: **Students Performance Dataset**
- File format: CSV

---

## ✅ Task Objectives Completed
- Loaded the dataset using `pandas.read_csv()`
- Explored the data using `.head()` and `.info()`
- Identified missing values using `.isnull().sum()`
- Cleaned missing values appropriately
- Removed duplicate records using `.drop_duplicates()`
- Verified and handled correct data types
- Created a new column using logical conditions (feature engineering)
- Saved the cleaned dataset as a new CSV file
- Added markdown explanations to document each step
